# bibbox-website

Bibbox from a website.

## Description

This project a provides library self-service from a website. It consists of the
following parts:

- An administration interface (for configuring machines) and website provider for the frontend (Symfony/PHP).
- A frontend (React) that exposes the library functions available to the user.
- An engine (Node.js) that handles communication between the frontend and FBS and handles state for each machine (FÃ¦lles bibliotekssystem).

A user can load a machine by a unique URL that is tied to a machine configuration.
