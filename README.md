# Bibbox Website

Bibbox from a website.

## Description

This project a provides library self-service from a website. It consists of the
following parts:

- A frontend that exposes the library functions available to the user (React).
- An administration interface (for configuring machines) and website provider for the frontend (Symfony/PHP).
- An engine that handles communication between the frontend and FBS (FÃ¦lles bibliotekssystem) and handles state for each machine (Node.js).

A user can load a machine by a unique URL that is tied to a machine configuration.

![alt text](docs/architecture.png "Architecture")

The frontend communicates with the engine through a web socket.
The machine state flows from the engine to the frontend.
The frontend reflects the given machine state.
User actions passes from the frontend to the engine.
The engine then changes the machines state and sends it back to the frontend.

## Tech stack

* Node.js 14.x
* Symfony 5.x
* PHP 7.4
* React 16.x
* Docker

## Development setup

A docker based development setup is provided with the project.

@TODO Maybe we should stipulate note that `docker-compose up -d` should not be run before everything is installed and configuration files are in place.

Install composer packages.
```sh
docker-compose run phpfpm composer install
```

Copy engine configuration files:

```sh
cp engine/example_config.json engine/config.json
cp engine/plugins/ctrl/example_config.json engine/plugins/ctrl/config.json
```

@TODO What can I edit in these configuration files? Can we use JSON5 in the files and add comments?

Install dependencies for engine and frontend.

@TODO Why do we run `npm` in two different ways here?

```
docker-compose run engine npm install
docker-compose run engine bash -c './scripts/install.sh'
docker-compose run frontend bash -c 'npm install'
```

This will start the engine and the frontend.
```sh
docker-compose up -d
```

Get url of the frontend:

```sh
echo http://$(docker-compose port nginx 80)
```

@TODO How do I restart the engine after configuration changes?

To restart the engine after changing configuration, run

```sh
docker-compose restart engine
```

*Install assets*
To install assets for the frontend we use Encore.

A docker container is started that watches for changes in the assets/js folder.

@TODO Which container is that?

## Code Linting

When PRs are created towards the develop branch all coding styles are checked by Github Actions.

### Frontend

To check for coding standards, run the following:

```sh
docker-compose exec frontend bash -c 'npm run check-coding-standards'
```

To automatically apply coding standards, run:

```sh
docker-compose exec frontend bash -c 'npm run apply-coding-standards'
```

### Engine

The same commands apply as frontend, be should be run from the `engine/` folder.

### Symfony

@TODO: Setup coding standards for the Symfony/PHP code.

## Testing

All tests runs with Github Actions for each PR to develop.

### Frontend

Frontend tests runs with jest.

```
docker-compose exec frontend bash -c 'npm test'
```

### Engine

Engine tests runs with mocha from the `engine/` directory. The tests that
call FBS are mocked with nock recordings (see the `test/fixtures` folder).

```
docker-compose exec engine bash -c 'npm test'
```

### Symfony

@TODO: Setup tests for the Symfony/PHP code.

## Production

### Building production assets for the frontend

```
docker-compose exec frontend bash -c 'npm run build'
```
